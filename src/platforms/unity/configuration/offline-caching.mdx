Offline caching is enabled by default. When a device is unable to send an event it is cached and we send a report once we receive another event. The SKD uses `Application.persistentDataPath` as base directory for caching. If you change this path take note that it should persist between sessions to capture events that would be lost otherwise.

```csharp
using Sentry;

// Add this to the SDK initialization callback
options.CacheDirectoryPath = "/your/custom/cache/path";
```
